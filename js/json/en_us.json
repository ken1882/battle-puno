  "BasicContent": "(the rules will be different from the offiical uno rules)<br><br><b>The Basic Game Flow:</b><br><br>Beginning:<br>At the beginning of the game, each player draws a card from the deck, and the player with the highest card point(see the 'Card Point' below) will play first with clockwise order. The card drawn will be visible for about 2 seconds.<br>Then, a first card will be drawn from the deck, which indicates the next card should be played.<br><br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/2HN19X3.jpg'><br><br>Main process:<br>The one plays the card must play the card matched to last card's colour(red/blue/green/yellow) or symbol(0-9, skip, reverse......). The wild cards can be played regardless of the color of previous card. The player will have to draw a card from the deck if they has no matched card to play(or simply doesn't want to play). When any player has no cards in the hand, the round ends and calculate the score.<br><br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/FjhLylr.jpg'><br>Hint: Click on the deck to draw a card, click on the card to play it, if it doesn't match, it won't be played.<br><br><br>Overtime:<br>When it comes there's no card left on deck, the game continues. If the player has no more card to play, they keeps the card in hand but no longer be able to play in this round(knocked out). The rest players follow the same process until there's only one player left and they also has no card to play.<br><br><br>",
  "TraditionalContent": "<img src='https://i.imgur.com/0GADpsH.jpg'><br><br>The traditional UNO mode, the goal is simple: empty the hand cards. But when you facing the penalty draws, you can play the skip/reverse card corresponding to its color to avoid the penalty by passing it to next player(skip) or counter to last player(reverse).<br><br>",
  "BattlePunoContent": "<img src='https://i.imgur.com/ptoTIeh.png'><br><br>In this mode, when a player played all of their hand cards. The round ends and everyone's hp will be reduced by the sum of card points in the hand, then the hitpoints left will convert to score.<br>The game ends whenever a player reachs the score goal.<br><br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/jgelMHo.png'><br><br><b>Taking damage and calculating:</b><br> When a numbered card is played, the damage pool will increased by its number. And if a player draws from the deck without penalty, they will take all damage in the damage pool, then the pool will reset to 0.<br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/bCdFhU2.png'><br>the damage effect is based on the cards in damage pool.<br><br>",
  "DeathMatchContent": "To be the last stand to win the game. Besides the rules from 'Battle Puno!', player will have to draw the card until the hand has same number as initially has. if player holding 2 more cards than initially has, from next of their turn, no matter skipped, will loses 1% of max hp, and 2%, 3%...and so on until having less than the 'threshold'. The status will shows as '*1', '*2'...representing the hp percentage will be lost next turn.<br>Also, a 'stacking penalty draw' will be applied. Player can also avoid the penalty draw by play any penalty draw card in the hand, but will draws will increased.<br><br><img src='https://i.imgur.com/GlmaM7n.jpg' width='50%' height='50%'><br>as the screenshot shows, '+10' is the result of stacked penalty and *3 means will loses hp equivalent to 3% of max hp next turn. And the damage effect is based on the cards the player has.<br><br>",
